- This project is built with Ruby on Rails 8
- Use Hotwire (Stimulus and Turbo) to make the app reactive
- Use Bulma css classes for styling, fallback to custom css if required
- Never use style html tags for css, all css sould be in a .css file
- Never use script html tags outside the main head, instead use stimulus js controllers
- Keep the code modularised so files and methods don't become too complex
- When modularizing the code prioritise model classes over services
- Follow DRY coding principles
- When calling external api's for front end data use the elements .src property with hotwire to dynamicaly load the componenet
- Never put in placeholder comments for code, ask a questions and context if detaisl are missing
- Never assume how an external api works, always look for the latest documentation
- Refactor your code to be DRY when you have finished your task
- Avoid going outside of the specified scope
- Do not use the ebay_service module, instead always use the ebay_api_client
- When adding code to the ebay_api_client do not mock results to get it working, find the solution
- Provide "data: { turbo_frame: "_top" }" to links when within a turbo frame
